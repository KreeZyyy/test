# Modular Switchboards 1.0.76 — longitudinal cable profiles

By **KreeZy**. Build and manually wire modular DIN switchboards in Stationeers.

## Native-inspired longitudinal wire profiles — 1.0.76

The visual generator now follows the supplied native cable references more closely: longitudinal dark sections replace the transverse stripe pattern. Thickness contrast is increased while retaining the current wire routes.

| Type | Maximum diameter | Identification |
|---|---:|---|
| Basic / Normal | 2.4 mm | Plain eight-sided coloured insulation |
| Heavy | 4.4 mm | Eight-sided profile with continuous black longitudinal faces |
| Super Heavy | 6.0 mm | Broad coloured shoulders around recessed black longitudinal channels, with silver metal end collars and periodic joints |

Super Heavy has 4 mm end collars and 4 mm wide silver joints spaced every 100 mm along longer connections. The collars/joints are visual parts of the same wire: they do not create extra electrical connections or consume additional coils. Three separate materials preserve the insulation colour, permanent black channels and permanent silver fittings when painted. Both preview and installed wire use the same generator.

Maximum radii remain below the existing router's obstacle clearance (3.4 mm) and half its wire-to-wire clearance (3.2 mm). Existing routes, saved wire types, network format, coil recovery and power simulation are unchanged. Existing typed wires gain the new visuals automatically when rebuilt. **Internal cable-type watt limits and burn damage are not enabled yet.**

Install the **test ZIP**, restart and check `[Modular Switchboards] 1.0.76 loaded.` in the current log. Compare all three types, paint a Super Heavy wire and verify its black channels and silver joints remain unchanged, then save/reload and cut it to check the coil refund. Host and clients need the same version. Build/geometry/paint-isolation checks pass locally; actual game rendering still needs verification.

## Requirements

This is a code mod. **A Workshop subscription alone does not install its loader.**

1. Install BepInEx and [StationeersLaunchPad](https://github.com/StationeersLaunchPad/StationeersLaunchPad/) following the loader's installation instructions.
2. Subscribe to [LibConstructReloaded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3751750326).
3. Install Modular Switchboards and enable it in LaunchPad. LibConstructReloaded must load first; this dependency is declared in About.xml.
4. Restart the game after changing code-mod files.

For a local ZIP installation, extract the **ModularSwitchboards** folder into `Documents/My Games/Stationeers/mods/`. The result must contain `mods/ModularSwitchboards/About/About.xml` and `mods/ModularSwitchboards/Assemblies/ModularSwitchboards.dll`.

Use the same version and required dependencies on the host/server and every multiplayer client. Enable only one local or Workshop copy of Modular Switchboards.

## What you can build

- Small cabinets with two 7-position DIN rows and two Outputs; Medium cabinets with double doors, three 14-position rows and three Outputs. Both sizes have reversed Input/Output variants.
- Breakers, replaceable fuse holders, battery backup, cable analyzers, ordinary and NC contactors.
- Four-position Small and six-position Medium transformers, adjustable up to 5 kW and 25 kW. Each uses 10 W for control electronics in the current game version, supplied at IN in addition to transferred power.
- Door LEDs, manual selectors/main switches, latching TOTAL STOP, individual hinge bridges, fitted inner covers and labels in 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6-position widths.
- Smart Core, Net and Output modules for programmable control.

## First circuit

Print the cabinet kit in the Electronics Printer. Right-click to choose the cabinet variant, place its frame and finish the shell with the indicated materials and Wrench. Print separate rail and module kits, open the door and fit the parts.

With the inner cover removed, use **Cable Coil, Heavy Cable Coil or Super Heavy Cable Coil** to connect contacts. Route cabinet **Input → protection → cabinet Output**. **Wire Cutters** remove wires. A cabinet does not connect its terminals automatically. Manual switches and contactors do not provide overload protection.

Use F1 for each part's contacts, rating, construction cost and controls. The cable analyzer tooltip and configuration tablet report the selected Input/Output network, not an isolated individual wire's consumption. Fit the inner cover after wiring, then add labels and edit them with a Labeller.

## Smart modules

- **Core:** four positions, runs an IC10 chip and provides its programmable display. The chip addresses Core itself as `db`.
- **Net:** one position, connects Core to a chosen data network through its DATA contact.
- **Output:** two positions, drives only the A1 control input of a classic DIN contactor. The contactor's separately protected IN/OUT carries the load. Select one of six private addresses, `d0` to `d5`, using the Output's screwdriver screw.

Net and Output extensions must form a continuous row directly to the left of Core. Core supplies their control bus. See `Examples/` for IC10 programs.

**Lua is optional.** Ordinary IC10 does not need StationeersLua. Lua programs need a compatible StationeersLua installation and a Lua chip; `Examples/DinSmartModule.lua` is an optional example.

## Typed internal wiring — added in 1.0.70

- Wire contacts using any of the three native coil types: Normal, Heavy or Super Heavy. Each completed connection consumes one unit of the coil held when you finish it.
- Wire maximum diameters are **2.4 / 4.4 / 6.0 mm** respectively; the route preview uses the same diameter. All fit inside the existing routing clearance. Paint colour remains independent of cable type.
- Wire Cutters return the matching native coil. Dismantling a connected module refunds each attached wire in its own coil type.
- XML saves and multiplayer state retain the type, route and paint. Existing wires load as Normal without losing their connections or colour. Host and clients must all update.
- **This first stage adds coil selection, appearance and persistence only. Internal wires do not yet burn or impose cable-type power limits.** Existing module protection and power simulation are unchanged.

Game test: use all three coils in one cabinet, compare the previews and finished thicknesses, paint a Heavy wire, save/reload, then cut it and check the returned coil. Also test mixed-type module-demolition refunds and multiplayer views. Use a copied world.

## Fitted covers — added in 1.0.68

This build adds a new saved item type. **Try it in a copy of your world before publishing or replacing a public installation.** Host and clients need the same version. Production costs are unchanged.

- Remove a labelled inner cover with a Wrench: recover **one non-stackable Fitted Switchboard Cover item** with its visible openings, labels, exact saved texts, positions and colour. Label kits are not refunded separately.
- Hold that item and left-click inside an open, uncovered cabinet of the **same size** for two seconds. Small/Reverse share covers; Medium/Medium Reverse share covers. No extra cover or label kits are consumed.
- Labels retain the aperture spans beneath their full DIN width. Adjacent labels can jointly preserve one wider opening. Current modules also create their required openings, even in previously solid areas.
- Removing a label immediately releases its own retained aperture span. A current module still keeps its necessary opening. A newly placed replacement label does not inherit a removed label's stale holes.
- On removal, openings without a retaining label are discarded. **With no labels at all, normal dismantling returns one Cover kit.**
- The item can be carried, dropped and precision-placed. Its shape preview is specific to the individual cover. Precision placement starts upright with the front facing the player; native rotation controls remain available. Save/load and network serialization retain the payload.
- A new cover initially follows cabinet paint. A loose fitted item retains its saved colour; after fitting, the cover follows the destination cabinet paint, including later repainting.

First game test: label a Medium cover, remove it with a Wrench, drop/pick up the item, save/reload, then fit it on another Medium with different modules. Remove a label above an empty retained opening and check that it closes; finally remove every label and recover a normal Cover kit. Also check host/client views and a failed attempt on a Small cabinet.

Gameplay wiring, power simulation and existing prefab identities are retained. The full public Workshop description and universal tablet readouts from 1.0.67 are included. Detailed older development history is in `CHANGELOG.md` in the source package.

Development is ongoing. New fitted-cover items do not exist in older builds, so do not use a test world's new objects with an older public version.
