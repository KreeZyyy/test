# Modular Switchboards 1.0.67

By **KreeZy**. Build and manually wire modular DIN switchboards in Stationeers.

## Requirements

This is a code mod. **A Workshop subscription alone does not install its loader.**

1. Install BepInEx and [StationeersLaunchPad](https://github.com/StationeersLaunchPad/StationeersLaunchPad/) following the loader's installation instructions.
2. Subscribe to [LibConstructReloaded](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3751750326).
3. Install Modular Switchboards and enable it in LaunchPad. LibConstructReloaded must load first; this dependency is declared in About.xml.
4. Restart the game after changing code-mod files.

For a local ZIP installation, extract the **ModularSwitchboards** folder into `Documents/My Games/Stationeers/mods/`. The result must contain `mods/ModularSwitchboards/About/About.xml` and `mods/ModularSwitchboards/Assemblies/ModularSwitchboards.dll`.

Use the same version and required dependencies on the host/server and every multiplayer client. Enable only one local or Workshop copy of Modular Switchboards.

## What you can build

- Small cabinets with two 7-position DIN rows and two Outputs; Medium cabinets with double doors, three 14-position rows and three Outputs. Both sizes have reversed Input/Output variants.
- Breakers, replaceable fuse holders, battery backup, cable analyzers, ordinary and NC contactors.
- Four-position Small and six-position Medium transformers, adjustable up to 5 kW and 25 kW. Each uses 10 W for control electronics in the current game version, supplied at IN in addition to transferred power.
- Door LEDs, manual selectors/main switches, latching TOTAL STOP, individual hinge bridges, fitted inner covers and labels in 1, 2, 3, 4 or 6-position widths.
- Smart Core, Net and Output modules for programmable control.

## First circuit

Print the cabinet kit in the Electronics Printer. Right-click to choose the cabinet variant, place its frame and finish the shell with the indicated materials and Wrench. Print separate rail and module kits, open the door and fit the parts.

With the inner cover removed, use **Cable Coil** to connect contacts. Route cabinet **Input → protection → cabinet Output**. **Wire Cutters** remove wires. A cabinet does not connect its terminals automatically. Manual switches and contactors do not provide overload protection.

Use F1 for each part's contacts, rating, construction cost and controls. The cable analyzer tooltip and configuration tablet report the selected Input/Output network, not an isolated individual wire's consumption. Fit the inner cover after wiring, then add labels and edit them with a Labeller.

## Smart modules

- **Core:** four positions, runs an IC10 chip and provides its programmable display. The chip addresses Core itself as `db`.
- **Net:** one position, connects Core to a chosen data network through its DATA contact.
- **Output:** two positions, drives only the A1 control input of a classic DIN contactor. The contactor's separately protected IN/OUT carries the load. Select one of six private addresses, `d0` to `d5`, using the Output's screwdriver screw.

Net and Output extensions must form a continuous row directly to the left of Core. Core supplies their control bus. See `Examples/` for IC10 programs.

**Lua is optional.** Ordinary IC10 does not need StationeersLua. Lua programs need a compatible StationeersLua installation and a Lua chip; `Examples/DinSmartModule.lua` is an optional example.

## Version 1.0.67

Workshop description and installation documentation prepared. The configuration tablet now identifies all switchboard parts: passive modules show their available read-only states, while Core, Smart Output and transformers retain the native device display. Analyzer power fields follow the native order and include PrefabHash, numeric ReferenceId and NameHash. This tablet display does not add IC10 addressability or change circuit behavior. Includes the corrected Smart kit models. Detailed development history is retained in `CHANGELOG.md` in the source package.

Development is ongoing. Test development builds in a copy of your world; new development-only parts may not exist in an older public release.
